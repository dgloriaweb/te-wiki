## Jobs

### Adding and editing similar jobs
This is a complex problem. Finding similar jobs requires a thorough search in the whole job database for jobs that requires very similar skillset. The best would be to do it automatically, but offering jobs the same way we offer skills would be another way. Also we need to avoid duplicates when entering jobs, and since we want to automate the job entry, the app should be able to offer similar jobs during setting up a job and make sure these arenâ€™t exactly the same. Maybe should consider similar job titles as group and not individual job. Not sure that this should be implemented at this point.
Jira: TAL-435 (later will be devided into smaller jobs)
